# Open Source Components for the Native SDK for BlackBerry&reg; Tablet OS

RIM has contributed initial ports of commonly used Open Source Libraries and Games to the QNX-based BlackBerry&copy; Tablet OS,
to be used in conjuction with the
[BlackBerry Native SDK for Tablet OS](http://blackberry.developer.com/native) (NDK).
RIM will collaborate with the existing open source communities to
incorporate these changes into the upstream repositories.

RIM has also released under an Open Source license some new convenience libraries and frameworks
and some samples that show how to use all this components to create applications for the BlackBerry&copy; PlayBook.

These components extend an already very comprehensive list of [libraries available with Tablet OS](http://developer.blackberry.com/native/documentation/com.qnx.doc.native_sdk.devguide/com.qnx.doc.native_sdk.devguide/topic/libraries.html).
