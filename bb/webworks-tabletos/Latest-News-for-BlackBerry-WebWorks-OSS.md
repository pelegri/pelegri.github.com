**Mar 9, 2011 - blackberry/WebWorks rtm2.0 Branch Added**
The latest internal code line for blackberry/WebWorks has been uploaded in the [rtm2.0 branch](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks/tree/rtm2.0).  This is the "Evacuation" source code for the pending v2.0 release of the BlackBerry WebWorks SDK for BlackBerry Smartphones.  This now has 100% of the BlackBerry WebWorks source code in the github repository. There will no longer be a dependency on BlackBerry handheld OS releases for API fixes or additions.

The official downloadable release of the BlackBerry WebWorks SDK v2.0 for BlackBerry Smartphones on blackberry.com is pending as we work through our final testing and documentation updates.

We are making a continued effort to have more of our forward looking branches available in github ensuring that the community has the ability to [contribute](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks-TabletOS/wiki/How-To-Contribute) to the most up-to-date source code.

The Beta 3 release of BlackBerry WebWorks for the Tablet OS has been tested and is pending official release on blackberry.com.  The current master branch for WebWorks-TabletOS is the Beta 3 source code for those who want to take a look before the official release becomes available for download.
