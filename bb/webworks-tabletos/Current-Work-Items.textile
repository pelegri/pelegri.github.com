There currently are many activities underway surrounding BlackBerry&reg; WebWorks for the Tablet OS and below you will find the different areas that are in currently in flight.
 
h3. BlackBerry WebWorks on Tablet OS core functionality

_*[Beta Now Available]*_ [[http://us.blackberry.com/developers/tablet/webworks.jsp]]
We have an entire team bringing the BlackBerry WebWorks platform to the BlackBerry PlayBook.  We are trying to get an initial beta out as quickly as possible.  We'll also be uploading the BlackBerry WebWorks source code to github so that you can also contribute to the code-base used on the BlackBerry PlayBook.

h3. Builds and Testing

When we first posted the source code to github we knew we still had work to do to get everything to where we wanted it to be.  We wanted to make sure that we had the source code available and people could get started, but we have more to come.
 
We have teams pulling together build scripts and testing frameworks built on open technologies so that you will be able to download the project, configure your environment, build the code and run the test suites.  We want to ensure we are enabling the community to be successful using open standard frameworks with no internal RIM sauce needed.
 
h3. BlackBerry Platform SDKs

We are also working with each of the BlackBerry Platform SDK teams such as payment, advertising, BBM etc to ensure that these great services will be available for the BlackBerry WebWorks platform on Tablet OS.
