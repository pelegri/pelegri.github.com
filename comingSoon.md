# Coming Soon

Below are some Open Source activities we have already announced collected for your convenience.

## WebKit

RIM is going to work more openly with the [WebKit.org](http://webkit.org) community. As indicated by George Staikos at [webkit-dev](https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2011-October/018264.html) on Oct 15:

> Hi all,

> I'm writing to inform you that we are preparing to land the QNX WebKit port.
> Since 2009, RIM (BlackBerry) has been integrating WebKit into its products
> and contributing to the WebKit open source project.  Our dedication to WebKit
> includes shipping it on all current products, contributing software to the project,
> as well as supporting some key people who are employed to work part-time or full-time on the
> webkit.org tree.  To date, our ports have not been integrated into the webkit.org
> repository.  However, this is in the process of changing as
> we are now integrating our QNX port into Subversion.  We are in the
> final stages of preparing a public build bot, rebaselining test
> results, and rebasing our port to the tip of tree.  Many of our QNX
> related changes are already integrated and we plan to begin submitting
> the rest shortly in coordination with additional upcoming open source
> initiatives.  It is our intention to do more development on our QNX
> port at webkit.org, and we look forward to any comments or suggestions
> on our approach.  We're excited to be working openly together with the
> community!

> Sincerely,

> The WebKit development team from RIM, QNX, and Torch Mobile (Beijing) Co. Ltd.

*Note*: Back in July we posted [WebKit Contributions for BlackBerry Smartphones](http://github.com/blackberry/WebKit-Smartphone). George's above statement regards contributing the changes back to the upstream community so they are useable by the whole community.

## Apache CouchDB

We are porting Apache CouchDB to work with BlackBerry&copy; Tablet OS.  In preparation we have already ported [Erlang-OTP](http://github.com/blackberry/Erlang-OTP) and [Mozilla SpiderMonkey](http://github.com/blackberry/SpiderMonkey).

## Qt

An initial port of Qt, including Qt core, used in Cascades, is [already available](http://github.com/blackberry/Qt).
More details in a future announcement.

## WebGL-Samples

The sources for the WebGL-based games shown during the keynotes at [DevCon 2011 America](http://www.blackberrydevcon.com/americas)
will be posted to the [WebGL-Samples](http://github.com/blackberry/WebGL-Samples) in the near future.

## Apache Callback

Apache recently [approved](http://markmail.org/message/prcqe76mbseycbwl#query:+page:1+mid:6fvnvrvfumuaviwh+state:results)
Callback as a project in the Apache incubator ([status page](http://incubator.apache.org/projects/callback.html)).
During the technical keynote at DevCon 2011 America, [Lauren Hasson](https://github.com/ldhasson) indicated:

> RIM has been very close to the PhoneGap team over the past year and WebWorks is already the infrastructure used by PhoneGap to
> target BlackBerry devices. We are extremely pleased with the move to Apache and RIM will continue to support the project with
> direct participation and contributions.
