## Feb 2014

### Mon, Feb 17 - fail
* Dropped at FIAT putman, with LCS-25p and instructions on how to try to reproduce the 120V message.
* Mechanic could not reproduce.  They left the car overnight.

### Tue, Feb 18 - fine
* Talked with mechanic and told him that other 500e showed 240V not 120V.
* I went to pick up the car late afternoon.  He showed me a 2014 that also showed 120V.  We tried it 3 times with me there, 2 it showed 120V, and once it showed 240V.  I took the car home.
* I plugged in the car.  It made the usual click-and-clack, and then it charged fine.
* Took the car to pick up flier at airport
* Plugged the car overnight.  The usual click-and-clack and then some grinding noise but it was charging fine.

### Wed, Feb 19 - fail
* Car didn't charge.  It looked as if it failed pretty soon after it started charging.
* Drove the car to SFO.  Flew to LAX.  Flew back.  Charged it for about 30min on a ChargePoint w/o problems
* Plugged it in at home, went to bed.  Car failed (see Thu)

### Thu, Feb 20 - fail, fine
* Car was fully charged in the morning
* Drove to work and back; let car rest and then tried to charge
* Tried twice to charge the char but car didn't register the plug at all.  Not even a light.  Charger cycled through cycling and not cycling.  I didn't let it go into a fault in both cases.
* Opened door, then tried again to plugin, this time more forcefully.
* Car reacted to the plug and charged fine this time.

### Fri, Feb 21 - fail, fail, fine
* Back home; tried to charge and failed once.  Usual failure click-and-clack noises.  Failure light, but car/ESEV tried to charge more than once.  Failure happened within the first 3 minutes.
* Unplugged, waited for systems to quiesce, then plugged in, now more forcefully.  It is charging right now.  Charged fine.

### Sat, Feb 22 - fail, fail, fine, fine, fail, fail, fine
* Battery down to 20% after trip up the peninsula.  Tried to charge and started charging.  2 minutes after it failed after the usual click-and-clack.  It then turned itself off and, without replugging in, it started trying to charge again.  2 more minutes and it did the same.  And once more.  I finally unplugged it.
* Drove to find another HCS-40.  Old model (Yazaki connector). Charged fine twice in a row.
* Tried again at home.  Failed twice in a row.
* Tried at home while pressing the connector by hand.  It charged fine.

### Sun, Feb 23 - fail, fail, fail
* Tried to charge while holding the connector firmly; failed with the usual clacking and the car reporting it was trying to charge
* Unplugged, unwound the cable and laid up on the floor. Tried again to charge while holding the connector firmly; this time the car reported it was plugged didn't even try to charge.
* Unplugged, tried again.  Also showed not trying to charge.  It reported "press now to charge", so I did that.  Twice.  No changes.  After a bit, the car now shows a charging fault.
* I unplugged and will take it to the dealer tomorrow morning.
