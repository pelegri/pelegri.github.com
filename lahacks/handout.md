# LAHacks Theme
Theme:  Node.js + IOT + Rollbase

# Details:
   Use Node.js to create an IOT application, optionally leveraging some Rollbase or other Pacific services (see below).  There is a small IOT lending library.  There are prizes.

# Lending Library Resources  
Qualcom Gimbal Series 10, RadBeacons, Pebble, Philips Hue  
You can keep your Qualcomm Gimbal at the end of the hackathon if you complete it  

# Judging Rules:
   Hacks will be judged on originality, technical difficulty, and applicability.  
   Extra points will be awarded if your hack leverages one of Pacific's services (see link), but that is not necessary.  

# Prizes:
   All teams that "complete" their hack can keep their Qualcom Gimbals  
   1st prize is a iPad mini retina  
   2nd prize is the Pebble or the Philips Hue SDK
