# How to borrow from other borrowers:
   If you need a resource that has already been allocated, I'll put the two teams in contact.  

   You can transfer directly from team to team ONLY for Gimbals  

   You need to transfer from team to Eduardo to team for ALL OTHER RESOURCES  
       (contact eduardo if you need to setup a different arrangement)

   You can keep your Qualcomm Gimbal at the end of the hackathon if you complete it  
   All other resources need to be returned to the booth by XXXXXX.  

# Judging Rules:
   Hacks will be judged on originality, technical difficulty, and applicability.  
   Extra points will be awarded if your hack leverages one of Pacific's services (see link), but that is not necessary.
