### Thu, Feb 19
* Car was fully charged in the morning
* Drove to work and back; let car rest
* Tried twice to charge the char but car didn't register the plug at all.  Not even a light.  Charger cycled through cycling and not cycling.  I didn't let it go into a fault in both cases.
* Opened door, then tried again to plugin, this time more forcefully.
* Car reacted to the plug
