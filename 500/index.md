# 500e Charging Log ([edit](https://github.com/pelegri/pelegri.github.com/edit/master/500/index.md))

## Feb 2014

### Mon, Feb 17
* Dropped at FIAT putman, with LCS-25p and instructions on how to try to reproduce the 120V message.
* Mechanic could not reproduce.  They left the car overnight.

### Tue, Feb 18
* Talked with mechanic and told him that other 500e showed 240V not 120V.
* I went to pick up the car late afternoon.  He showed me a 2014 that also showed 120V.  We tried it 3 times with me there, 2 it showed 120V, and once it showed 240V.  I took the car home.
* I plugged in the car.  It made the usual click-and-clack, and then it charged fine.
* Took the car to pick up flier at airport
* Plugged the car overnight.  The usual click-and-clack and then some grinding noise but it was charging fine.

### Wed, Feb 19
* Car didn't charge.  It looked as if it failed pretty soon after it started charging.
* Drove the car to SFO.  Flew to LAX.  Flew back.  Charged it for about 30min on a ChargePoint w/o problems
* Plugged it in at home, went to bed.

### Thu, Feb 20
* Car was fully charged in the morning
* Drove to work and back; let car rest and then tried to charge
* Tried twice to charge the char but car didn't register the plug at all.  Not even a light.  Charger cycled through cycling and not cycling.  I didn't let it go into a fault in both cases.
* Opened door, then tried again to plugin, this time more forcefully.
* Car reacted to the plug and charged fine this time.
